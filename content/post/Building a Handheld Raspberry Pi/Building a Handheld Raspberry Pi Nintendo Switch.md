# Building a Handheld Raspberry Pi Nintendo Switch

## Introduction

When Nintendo's Raspberry Pi was first launched, I thought it was the perfect platform to game on the go. It had 720p, 6 inch screen with new portable controller design that detaches from the main console. 

Nintendo Switch inspired me to design my own little hand held console. For many years, I have been interested in retro game console emulation and portable computing. 

Some portable hand held consoles I have always been eyeballing

- GPH GP2x Caanoo
- GPH GP2x Wiz
- Open Pandora (Now known as PYRA)
- Dingoo 
- GCW Zero

These aren't your traditional "Nintendo DS" or "PSP" handhelds. All of these clock a variant of ARM processor that run Linux in its core.  Many of these handheld gaming handhelds have been defunct since around 2013, and there hasn't been a new contender in the field in the handheld market. 

This is where Raspberry Pi comes in play in 2018. Raspberry Pi is one of the most hardware and software support by the primary source and community. Naturally, people have programmed and found ways to run emulators on Raspberry Pi at full speeds for a pleasant gaming emulation experiences. This allowed me to choose Raspberry Pi to be the core of this handheld console build. 

## Copying Nintendo Switch (Physical Dimensions)

Nintendo Switch itself is a very slick device. Like rest of its predecessors, it is built with durability in mind, and intricately designed parts caused many problems during the designing process of the Raspberry Pi Switch.

### Body

Nintendo Switch's official dimensions can be found on the American Nintendo's website

In the official size dimensions it is said that "the body is 4 inches high, 9.4 inches long, and .55 inches deep". Lengt
